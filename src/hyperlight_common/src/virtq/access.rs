//! Memory Access Traits for Virtqueue Operations
//!
//! This module defines the [`MemOps`] trait that abstracts memory access patterns
//! required by the virtqueue implementation. This allows the virtqueue code to
//! work with different memory backends e.g. Host vs Guest.

use alloc::sync::Arc;

use bytemuck::Pod;

/// Backend-provided memory access for virtqueue.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementations must ensure that:
/// - Addresses accepted by these methods are translated according to the
///   backend's memory model.
/// - Invalid or inaccessible addresses are reported with `Self::Error` rather
///   than causing undefined behavior.
/// - Memory ordering guarantees are upheld as documented.
/// - Typed reads/writes and atomic operations honor alignment and initialized
///   memory requirements for the translated addresses.
///
/// [`RingProducer`]: super::RingProducer
/// [`RingConsumer`]: super::RingConsumer
