# Benchmark Notes

Hyperlight uses the [Criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) framework to run and analyze benchmarks. A benefit to this framework is that it doesn't require the nightly toolchain.

## When Benchmarks are run

1. Daily (scheduled)
    - Benchmarks run daily via `DailyBenchmarks.yml`. Results are stored as workflow artifacts with 90-day retention, and are what pull requests are compared against.

    ```
    sandboxes/create_sandbox
                        time:   [33.803 ms 34.740 ms 35.763 ms]
                        change: [+0.7173% +3.7017% +7.1346%] (p = 0.03 < 0.05)
                        Change within noise threshold.*
    ```
   
2. For each pull request
    - Benchmarks run on every hypervisor and cpu vendor in `ValidatePullRequest.yml`, which invokes `dep_benchmarks.yml`. The results are reported against the daily benchmarks of the commit the pull request branched from, and posted as a comment.

3. For each release
    - For each release, benchmarks are run as part of the release pipeline in `CreateRelease.yml`, which invokes `dep_benchmarks.yml`. These benchmark results are compared to the previous release, and are uploaded as part of the "Release assets" on the GitHub release page.

Currently, benchmarks are run on windows, linux-kvm (ubuntu), and linux-hyperv (mariner). Only release builds are benchmarked, not debug.

## Criterion artifacts

When running `cargo bench -- --save-baseline my_baseline`, criterion runs all benchmarks defined in `src/hyperlight_host/benches/`, prints the results to the stdout, as well as produces several artifacts. All artifacts can be found in `target/criterion/`. For each benchmarking group, for each benchmark, a subfolder with the name of the benchmark is created. This folder in turn contains folders `my_baseline`, `new`  and `report`. When running `cargo bench`, criterion always creates `new` and `report`, which always contains the most recent benchmark result and html report, but because we provided the `--save-baseline` flag, we also have a `my_baseline` folder, which is an exact copy of `new`. Moreover, if this `my_baseline` folder already existed before we ran `cargo bench -- --save-baseline my_baseline`, criterion would also compare the benchmark results with the old `my_baseline` folder, and then overwrite the folder.

The first time we run `cargo bench -- --save-baseline my_baseline` (starting with a clean project), we get the following structure. 

```
target/criterion/
|-- report
`-- sandboxes
    |-- create_sandbox
    |   |-- my_baseline
    |   |-- new
    |   `-- report
    |-- create_sandbox_and_call_context
    |   |-- my_baseline
    |   |-- new
    |   `-- report
    `-- report
```

If we run the exact same command again, we get 

```
target/criterion/
|-- report
`-- sandboxes
    |-- create_sandbox
    |   |-- change
    |   |-- my_baseline
    |   |-- new
    |   `-- report
    |-- create_sandbox_and_call_context
    |   |-- change
    |   |-- my_baseline
    |   |-- new
    |   `-- report
    `-- report
```

Note that it overwrote the previous `my_baseline` with the new result. But notably, there is a new `change` folder, which contains the benchmarking difference between the two runs. In addition, on stdout you'll also find a comparison to our previous `my_baseline` run.

```
                        time:   [40.434 ms 40.777 ms 41.166 ms]
                        change: [+0.0506% +1.1399% +2.2775%] (p = 0.06 > 0.05)
                        No change in performance detected.
Found 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)
```

**Note** that Criterion does not differ between release and debug/dev benchmark results, so it's up to the developer to make sure baselines of the same config are compared.

## Running benchmarks locally

Use `just bench` to run benchmarks with release builds (the only supported configuration). Comparing local benchmark results to the ones CI measures doesn't say much, since you'd be using different hardware, but `cargo ci bench-report` fetches them for you.

`cargo ci bench-report` renders the comparison. `--candidate` and `--baseline` say where each side comes from: a criterion directory, `run:<ID>` for a CI run, `pr:<NUMBER>` for the latest run of a pull request, `commit:<SHA>` for the benchmarks of the default branch taken at or before a commit, `base-of:<NUMBER>` for the ones taken where a pull request branched, or `release:<TAG>` for the ones a release carries. Criterion keeps the last run of a directory in `new` and the one before it in `base`, so a directory on its own reports the last run against the previous one.

The default branch is benchmarked daily rather than per commit, so `commit:` and `base-of:` take the closest run that does not carry changes the commit never had. A pull request defaults to the branch point it was built from, since nothing within its own results says what they mean. Workflow artifacts are swept away after 90 days, so reaching further back means the results a release carries. CI results cover every hypervisor and cpu vendor, so results are paired with the ones measured on the same kind of machine. A run records its own operating system, cpu vendor and hypervisor, and CI artifacts are named after the configuration that produced them. Results that fit no counterpart, or several, are reported without a comparison.

```sh
# a pull request against the branch point it was built from
cargo ci bench-report --candidate pr:1529
# this machine against the configuration in CI that matches it
cargo ci bench-report --baseline pr:1529
# this machine against what a release measured
cargo ci bench-report --baseline release:v0.17.0
```

**Important**: The `just bench` command uses release builds by default to ensure meaningful performance measurements. For profiling purposes, you can compile benchmarks with debug symbols by running `cargo bench` directly.
