# Hyperlight snapshot on-disk format

Hyperlight serialises a `Snapshot` to disk as an [OCI Image Layout]
directory. `Snapshot::save` writes one. `Snapshot::load` and
`Snapshot::checked_load` read one back.

Only a snapshot taken after the guest has run can be persisted. Such a
snapshot carries the captured vCPU registers needed to resume a call.
`Snapshot::save` rejects a pre-init snapshot.

## Directory layout

```text
path/
  oci-layout                          {"imageLayoutVersion":"1.0.0"}
  index.json                          one manifest descriptor per tag,
                                      tagged via the OCI standard
                                      `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name`
                                      annotation
  blobs/sha256/
    <manifest-digest>                 OCI image manifest JSON
    <config-digest>                   Hyperlight config JSON
    <snapshot-digest>                 raw memory bytes
                                      (`memory_size` bytes)
    <transport-digest>                canonical virtqueue rings
```

Four blob kinds per tag:

* **manifest** (`application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`). Tiny JSON
  pointer record selected via `index.json`. References one config and
  two layers by digest.
* **config** (`application/vnd.hyperlight.snapshot.config.v3+json`). The
  snapshot descriptor: arch, hypervisor, CPU vendor, ABI version,
  resume address and captured registers, memory and transport layout,
  registered host functions, snapshot generation counter, and namespaced
  application metadata. Loaded eagerly and fully parsed.
* **layer / memory** (`application/vnd.hyperlight.snapshot.memory.v1`).
  The raw guest memory image, exactly `memory_size` bytes. mmap'd on
  restore.
* **layer / transport**
  (`application/vnd.hyperlight.snapshot.transport.v1`). A bounded
  binary image of the canonical G2H and H2G rings. Loading checks ring
  sizes and canonical state against the config.

The runtime queue protocol and canonical checkpoint are described in
[Virtqueue host and guest communication](./virtio-host-guest-communication.md).

Blob filenames are the sha256 of the blob bytes, so identical blobs
across tags are stored once.

## Application metadata

`Snapshot::with_metadata` creates a snapshot that shares the source snapshot's
sandbox state and stores a serializable value under an application-owned
namespace. `Snapshot::metadata` deserializes the value for that namespace.
The source snapshot remains unchanged.

Metadata is stored in the config blob as a JSON object with namespaces as
keys. Snapshots without metadata omit the field. The loader treats a missing
field as an empty map, so snapshots written before metadata support remain
loadable. Metadata counts toward the config blob size limit.

## Transport framing

The transport layer is at most 2 MiB. Integers are unsigned and little-endian.
Sizes and lengths are in bytes. The fixed header is 40 bytes:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 8 | Magic `HLVQSNAP` |
| 8 | 4 | Version, `1` |
| 12 | 4 | Reserved, `0` |
| 16 | 8 | Scratch size |
| 24 | 8 | G2H ring image length |
| 32 | 8 | H2G ring image length |

The G2H image follows the header. The H2G image follows the G2H image.
The blob length must equal the header size plus both image lengths.

The codec validates framing. Snapshot loading validates the ring contents
against the finalized memory layout before admitting the snapshot.

## What is one snapshot

A single saved `Snapshot` consists of exactly:

* one entry in `index.json`, carrying the `tag` as
  `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name`, plus advisory
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.arch`,
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.hypervisor`, and
  `dev.hyperlight.snapshot.cpu.vendor` annotations that mirror the
  config blob for tooling visibility,
* one **manifest** blob (referenced by that index entry),
* one **config** blob (referenced by the manifest's `config` field),
* one memory **layer** blob,
* one transport **layer** blob.

Saving two snapshots under different tags into the same `path`
produces two index entries and two manifests. Configs and layers are
deduplicated by content, so identical bytes are stored once and
referenced by both manifests.

Saving the same tag a second time replaces that tag's index entry
and writes a fresh manifest. The previous manifest, and any of its
config or layer blobs that no other tag references, become orphans
in `blobs/sha256/`.

## Write semantics

`Snapshot::save(path, tag)` opens or creates the OCI layout at
`path` and writes one snapshot under `tag`, an [`OciTag`] whose
grammar is validated when it is parsed. It returns the manifest
descriptor digest as an [`OciDigest`], a content address that selects
the written manifest on a later load. The parent directory of `path`
must exist. `path` itself is created if absent. An existing
layout at `path` is preserved: other tags are kept, and a tag equal
to `tag` is replaced.

[`OciTag`]: https://docs.rs/hyperlight-host/latest/hyperlight_host/sandbox/snapshot/struct.OciTag.html
[`OciDigest`]: https://docs.rs/hyperlight-host/latest/hyperlight_host/sandbox/snapshot/struct.OciDigest.html

`index.json` is rewritten via a tmp file plus `rename`, the commit
point for the whole operation. Concurrent readers observe either the
prior layout or the new one, never a partial write. Power-loss
durability is the caller's responsibility: add `fsync` on the file
and parent directory if a crash must not lose a committed tag.

Replaced tags leave orphan blobs behind. To compact, remove the
directory and re-save. Concurrent writers to the same `path` are
unsupported.

This mirrors the merge behaviour of `containers/image` (skopeo,
podman), `go-containerregistry` (crane), and `regclient`.

## Read semantics

`Snapshot::load(path, reference)` reads a snapshot. It does not check
the manifest, config, memory, or transport blobs against their sha256 digests.
`reference` is an
[`OciReference`], either a tag that matches the
`org.opencontainers.image.ref.name` annotation or the manifest
digest returned by `save`. `Snapshot::checked_load` adds the digest
check on all four blobs, catching accidental corruption on disk.
Both run every other check (OCI structure, descriptor sizes, schema
versions, arch / hypervisor / CPU vendor / ABI tags, layout bounds,
entrypoint bounds). The caller is responsible for trusting the source.

A reference that matches no manifest, or a tag that matches more than
one manifest in `index.json`, is rejected.

## Portability

Snapshot images are bound to a specific CPU architecture, hypervisor,
and CPU vendor. All three are recorded in the config blob and checked
at load time, with mismatches rejected with a clear error. The
hypervisor tag (`kvm`, `mshv`, `whp`) constrains the host OS. The CPU
vendor is the x86_64 CPUID leaf-0 vendor string (e.g. `GenuineIntel`)
or the aarch64 `MIDR_EL1` implementer byte. A load on a different
vendor is rejected because the resumed CPU state can be incompatible.
A future version may relax this binding once a wider compatibility set
is proven safe.
